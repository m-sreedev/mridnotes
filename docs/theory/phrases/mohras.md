Mohras are a special type of mathematical pieces played towards the end of a  <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/thani/">Thani</a> to denote it's ending. <br>
A Mohra is customarily followed by a <a href  = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/korvais/"> Korvai</a> played three times.

<p>
    Mohras usually involve <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/pharans/"> Pharans</a> patterns. A good Mohra acts like a rhythmic and mathematical bridge between the <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/pharans/"> Pharans</a> and the <a href  = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/korvais/"> Korvai</a>.
