<h2> Matra </h2>

<p>In the classical music world, Matra is the  basic unit of time.</p>

<p>
All the pieces we play (Korvais, Mohras, Muthayippus) are measured in Matras. Talams are set in order to measure the progression of Matra.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at an example. <br>
Chaturasra Jathi Jampa Talam (Adi Talam), is comprised of 8 beats. 4 for Lakhu, 2 each for 2 Dhruthams (100). <a href  = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/talam/"> Click here if you do not understand the previous sentence.</a> <br>
In Chaturasra Gathi, between each beat there is a time-gap to play a piece (chollu) in the Madhyama Kalam (medium speed) of Matra 4.
</p>

<p>
There is also something subtle over here.
Suppose some Talam (say, the regular 8-beat) is put on a metronome. Since the Talam is put by a machine, the time-gap between succsessive beats is the same upto a very high accuracy.<br>
But the chollu ThaRiKiTa and ThaThiKiTaThom or even TthaTthiKiTaThom can be played within this gap. So which among the three is of Matra 4? Surely all of them cannot be of the same Matra. <br>
Therefore Matra of a chollu is a convention. It is the time taken for the piece to be played in medium speed in Chaturasra Gathi. Adi Talam is 32 Matras. When we play ThaThiKiTaThom or TthaTthiKiTaThom within a beat, we are playing in Khanda Gathi and Misra Gathi respectively.
