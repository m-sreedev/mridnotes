<h2> Muthayippus </h2>

Muthayippus are pieces played to mark the end of something.
They are mathematical, but much smaller than a  <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/korvais/"> Korvai. <br>

Muthayippus are usually placed thrice, or three pieces of progression of a pattern is played. <br>

The shorter version of a Muthayippu played in-between compositions or Thani, is called an Aruthi. <br>

Muthayippus are versatile like Korvais i.e, they come in many  <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/gathi/"> Gathis </a>, Kalams, different blends of the two and is a quick way to show a percussionist's intellect, creativity and talent. <br>
