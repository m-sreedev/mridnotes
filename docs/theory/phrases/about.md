    Hello!<br><br>
    I'm Sreedev M and I've been playing and learning Mridangam for almost 15 years. <br>
    I've built this site as an archive of all my notes, learnings and techniques
    I've picked up from many people over the years, most importantly my Guru, <b>Dr. K Jayakrishnan.</b> <br>
    Hope this would help in your journey too.<br>
    <br>Adios.
  </p>
