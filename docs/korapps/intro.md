Korappus are  sorted by  their <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/matra/"> Matras </a> for organization purposes.

<b> Just click on any Matra to jump to the section. </b>

I have also  tried to link the variations of the Korappu, if it has any. If you can create one and want me to add it to the collection, feel free to drop a <a href = "mailto:sreedevmelemadom@gmail.com.">mail.</a> <br><br>
