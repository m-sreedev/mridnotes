Muthayippus are pieces played to mark the end of something.
They are mathematical, but much smaller than a  <a href = "{{site.baseurl}}/docs/theory/phrases/korvais/"> Korvai. <br>

<p>
Muthayippus are  sorted by their Matras for organization purposes.
<p> <b> Just click on any Matra to jump to the section.</b></p>

If you can create one and want me to add it to the collection, feel free to drop a <a href = "mailto:sreedevmelemadom@gmail.com.">mail.</a> <br><br>
Credits are given to the people from whom I had heard the piece for the first time<br>
